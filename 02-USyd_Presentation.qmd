## Acknowledgement of Country

![](figure/country.jpg){fig-align="center"}

<br>

We acknowledge the tradition of custodianship and law of the Country on
which the University of Sydney campuses stand. We pay our respects to
those who have cared and continue to care for Country.

We are 95% confident that the proportion of Australian adults who are
concerned about **climate change** and its impact is somewhere between
*0.6* and *0.83.*

**Q: Did our net (confidence interval) capture the fish (the population
proportion** $p$)?

::: incremental
A: We do not know and will never know in reality!

-   Each confidence interval either **captures** the fish or **fails to
    capture** the "fish".

-   A 95% CI is constructed with the expectation that, in the long run,
    95% of such nets (CIs) will capture the "fish" ($p$).

-   We are *95% confident* that the proportion of Australian adults who
    are concerned about climate change and its impact is somewhere
    between *0.6* and *0.833.*

## Proposed Assessment

## Proposed Assessment

::: incremental
Students will:

-   Research the UNSDG 17 goals and select one that resonates most with
    them.

-   Find a recent media report on this issue.

-   Modify the provided R code to construct, visualise and communicate
    the bootstrap CI in the context of the selected UNSDG goal.

-   A minute paper to reflect of the core concept of CI.
